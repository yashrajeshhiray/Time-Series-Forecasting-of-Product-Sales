# Time-Series-Forecasting-of-Product-Sales
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on Time Series Data and trained various Time Series and Machine Learning models for forecasting the sales of the products.
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal ARIMA, Holt Winterâ€™s Triple Exponential Smoothing, Machine learning algorithms, and Hybrid ensemble models like Voting Regressor were models trained.
- Techniques used were Time Series Decomposition Plots, Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test, Autocorrelation (ACF) and Paired Autocorrelation (PACF) Plots, Plotting Rolling statistics for checking the stationarity of data, and differencing technique. We found out that Hybrid Ensemble Models outperformed all other models.
